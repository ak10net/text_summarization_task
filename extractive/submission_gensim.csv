0a000f521734500aa360bf6bb2bb31446e4d66cd.story,"Rory McIlroy is off to a good start at the Scottish Open. He's hoping for a good finish, too, after missing the cut at the Irish Open. McIlroy shot a course record 7-under-par 64 at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday, and he was actually the second player to better the old mark -- Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg had earlier fired a 65. McIlroy carded eight birdies and one bogey in windy, chilly conditions. Going out this morning in these conditions I thought anything in the 60s would be a good score, so to shoot something better than that is pleasing, McIlroy was quoted as saying by the European Tour's website. A win Sunday would be the perfect way for former No. 1 McIlroy to prepare for the British Open, which starts next week at Royal Liverpool. He won the last of his two majors in 2012. Everything was pretty much on, McIlroy said. ""I controlled my ball flight really well, which is the key to me playing well in these conditions and on these courses. I've been working the last 10 days on keeping the ball down, hitting easy shots and taking spin off it, and I went out there today and really trusted what I practiced. Last year Phil Mickelson used the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart as the springboard to his British Open title and his 68 leaves him well within touching distance of McIlroy. Mickelson needs a jolt of confidence given that 'Lefty' has slipped outside the top 10 in the rankings and hasn't finished in the top 10 on the PGA Tour this season. I thought it was tough conditions, Mickelson said in an audio interview posted on the European Tour's website. ""I was surprised to see some low scores out there because it didn't seem like it was playing easy, and the wind was pretty strong. I felt like I played well and had a good putting day. It was a good day. Last year's U.S. Open champion, Justin Rose, was tied for 13th with a 69 but Jonas Blixt -- who tied for second at the Masters -- was well adrift following a 74.","Rory McIlroy is off to a good start at the Scottish Open.

0a0a4c90d59df9e36ffec4ba306b4f20f3ba4acb.story,"(CNN) -- Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that ""fracking"" -- a process used to drill for natural gas -- is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light? Some scoff at the notion that movies do anything more than entertain. They are wrong. Sure, it's unlikely that one movie alone will change your views on issues of magnitude. But a movie (or TV show) can begin your ""education"" or ""miseducation"" on a topic. And for those already agreeing with the film's thesis, it can further entrench your views. Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide. They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right. The first, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture. The second, ""Promised Land,"" stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers. Critics of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden. They are rightfully concerned that the film will sway some to become more receptive or even supportive of the idea of torturing prisoners. Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden? Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators -- John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein -- sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as ""grossly inaccurate and misleading."" The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has ""an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative."" The hostility toward ""Promised Land"" shows us that it's not just politicians who complain about movie messages. Big business -- namely, the gas industry -- is aggressively objecting to the allegation in ""Promised Land"" that fracking poses environmental and health risks. How concerned is the gas industry? It has set up a rapid response team to counter publicity for the film by using two Washington-based groups that lobby for gas and oil companies: the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Energy in Depth. These groups have scrutinized appearances by the films stars on talk shows, questioned who the financiers of the film are, published parts of the script and mocked the film on social media. Energy in Depth went as far as to ""fact check"" a recent appearance by the film's co-star and co-writer, John Krasinski, on ""Late Night With David Letterman."" Within hours of Krasinski's appearance, Energy in Depth posted a blog on its website pointing out what it perceived as factual errors made by Krasinski about fracking. Regardless of whether ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Promised Land"" intended to promote any message, people who watch them will be ""educated"" in some way on torture and fracking -- even if very subtly. This is the same reason that minority groups continue to object to being represented in a negative light in movies and TV. They understand that accurate representations matter because studies have shown that biases can form based on stereotypes or inaccurate representations. (Being of Italian and Arab descent, I'm acutely aware of this issue as my respective heritages have been represented by a parade of mobsters and terrorists.) What's Hollywood's role in all of this? The same as it has always been -- to make money. In fact, there's no doubt that the studios behind these movies are overjoyed at the controversy that has erupted and the resulting free press. Indeed, the response of Sony Pictures to the uproar over ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tells you about what they really hope we will all do: ""We encourage people to see the film before characterizing it."" So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues. But while you are watching them, be aware you might be getting more than the price of ticket. You might also be getting a (mis)education. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators -- John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein -- sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as ""grossly inaccurate and misleading.""

0a0aa464d262b903f44b0f8eaa67f13dd1946cfd.story,"March 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd. Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14. That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day. A quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter. It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences. Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator. What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers. 3.1415926535897932 ... etc. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music. On Pi Day, one number 'reeks of mystery' Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day. One might even say -- gasp! -- it's cool to like pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009. In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. ""And so Pi Day is an acquired taste,"" mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail. Conveniently, ""pi"" sounds like ""pie,"" and pies are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza. If you're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already. But if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities. Where Pi Day began If you want to go where the day is said to be ""invented,"" look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there. Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff. Now it's a public pi extravaganza featuring a ""Pi procession,"" whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi's digits: 3.14159265 ... you get the idea. The parade ends at the ""pi shrine"" -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year. For those who can't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes ""irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing."" The museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi. On Pi Day, is 'pi' under attack? Where Einstein lived On the opposite coast, the leafy university town where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community-wide exuberance for pi. Princeton, New Jersey, kicks off Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading by physicist Charles Adler, then heads into a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pizza pie-making contest. The pie-eating contest takes place at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein look-alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the Princeton Public Library. Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7- to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred (That is, $314.15). The Historical Society of Princeton will have an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will speak at the library as well. Here are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize The ""brainiac town"" residents ""love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are,"" said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. ""A lot of them get super into it."" Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said. Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting (As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006). Even more pi Chicago is getting into the pi business too. Lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering Pi Day specials. The Illinois Science Council and Fleet Feet Sports are hosting a 3.14-mile walk/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Albert, Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the City of Brotherly Love. Bostonians can head to Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi Time (3:14 p.m.) for pi-themed activities such as ""Throw Pie at Your Best Friend on High-Speed Camera."" The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too. Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as ""Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art,"" according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their schedule of math-inspired films and tours throughout the day. There are plenty of online resources too, such as piday.org. Outside of the physical classroom, Pi Day will be celebrated online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book ""The Joy of Pi,"" is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory. How did Pi Day become such a big thing? Blatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new ""Cosmos"" TV show is getting so much attention. People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting, he said in an e-mail. ""We know math and science is important, we know that it's fascinating, but we often don't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say 'Hey, it IS kind of neat!' "" If you agree, just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular Facebook group calls it, ""The Only Pi Day of Our Lives."" That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection. So get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That'll be worth more than a thousand digits.

0a0adc84ccbf9414613e145a3795dccc4828ddd4.story,"Beijing (CNN) -- Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city. After unsuccessfully demanding a meeting with the Malaysian ambassador at their hotel for more than eight hours, angry relatives pushed past police officers who tried to stop them from making a midnight march across the Chinese capital. Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy. The ambassador kept saying he would come but he never showed, an elderly man told CNN as he and scores of others walked quietly through Beijing's streets. As has been the practice of many other Chinese passengers' next of kin, the man asked not to publish his name. They're lying. They're lying to us, the man repeated. ""And now we're going to the embassy. If they won't come to us, we'll go to them."" The surreal late-night procession was followed closely by police squad cars. Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates. Though vastly out-numbered by Chinese security forces, the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning. They remained camped out by the diplomatic mission more than 15 hours later. Periodically, they chanted ""Fulfill your commitments! No more delays! No more lies!"" Throughout the sit-in, no Malaysian diplomat came out to meet with protesters. The demonstrators finally dispersed peacefully before sunset on Friday, after camping out by the diplomatic mission for more than 17 hours. The small gathering departed after delivering a letter of protest to the embassy demanding an explanation for how the prime minister of Malaysia has concluded that the plane ended its flight over the Indian Ocean. Broken promises For weeks, distraught next of kin have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials. They are demanding a briefing on details of the last moments before Flight 370 was believed to have disappeared over the Indian Ocean. In the absence of information from Malaysian authorities, many relatives continue to believe their missing loved ones are still alive. On several occasions within the last two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly pledged to meet the Chinese families within a matter of 24 hours, but then failed to show up for talks. We just want them to stop breaking their promises again and again, said Steven Wang, a spokesman for the families, whose mother went missing when the Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8. He spoke to CNN in a ""journalist's area"" located out of sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest. Even at the early hour of 1 a.m. on Friday, Chinese police had cordoned off an area for media around the corner from the sit-in. During the day, security forces continued to prevent journalists from reaching the families. Public protests are extremely rare in China. The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese nationals who were on board the plane, has put Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position. The Chinese government has tolerated -- but stopped far short of endorsing -- the political mobilization of the flight's next of kin. Families have organized committees, issued press releases, and printed t-shirts and hats with the slogan ""Pray for MH370."" But they have also been largely prevented from organizing public displays outside the windowless hotel conference room that serves as the families' improvised headquarters. On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to ""express their appeals in a legal and rational way"" while pledging to give them further assistance. He urged the Malaysian authorities to ""actively"" pursue the investigation.","Beijing (CNN) -- Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.

0a0c2f4e07ba05f3226e8afec1350ac82161cd2e.story,"The White House Wednesday said it was ""puzzled"" by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth. Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book. In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush ""and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war."" [I]n this regard, he was terribly ill-served by his top advisers, especially those involved directly in national security, McClellan wrote. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House ""sad.""  Read excerpts from the book » Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House, Perino said. ""For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew."" McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book. Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to Bush, said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns. Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues, said Townsend, now a CNN contributor. ""For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional."" Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he's read sound more like they were written by a ""left-wing blogger"" than his former colleague. Rove declined to comment to CNN after the Fox News interview. In a brief phone conversation with CNN Tuesday evening, McClellan made clear that he stands behind the accuracy of his book. McClellan said he cannot give on-the-record quotes yet because of an agreement with his publisher.  Watch further details emerge from McClellan's book » Another former Bush aide-turned-critic says the reaction to McClellan's book by his former colleagues has a familiar ring to it. They're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me, Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, told CNN. Clarke left government in 2003. The following year, he accused President Bush of ignoring warnings about the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for war with Iraq. But Clarke gave McClellan little credit for speaking out now. I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know -- that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [and] was sold with deception. It's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said. Besides his criticism of how the administration handled the run-up to the Iraq war, McClellan also sharply criticizes the administration on its handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in the book. One of the worst disasters in our nation's history became one of the biggest disasters in Bush's presidency, he wrote. ""Katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define Bush's second term."" Early in the book, which CNN obtained late Tuesday, McClellan wrote that he believes he told untruths on Bush's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity was leaked to the media. Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame -- whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone public with charges the Bush administration had ""twisted"" facts to justify the war in Iraq. Libby was convicted last year of lying to a grand jury and federal agents investigating the leak. Bush commuted his 30-month prison term, calling it excessive. At the time, McClellan called the three ""good individuals"" and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved. I had allowed myself to be deceived into unknowingly passing along a falsehood, he wrote. ""It would ultimately prove fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively."" McClellan wrote he didn't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later. A former spokesman for Bush when he was governor of Texas, McClellan was named White House press secretary in 2003, replacing Ari Fleischer. McClellan had previously been a deputy press secretary and was the traveling spokesman for the Bush campaign during the 2000 election. He announced he was resigning in April 2006 at a news conference with Bush. One of these days, he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary, Bush said at that conference. ""And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done.""","In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush ""and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war.""

0a0d11c125e4e4b061061f44b08f60cb5b8bf177.story,"Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company's lack of management diversity -- that is, women. As The New York Times put it last week, ""The board? All white men. The investors? All men. The executive officers? All men but for the general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks."" Question: Why is this a problem? First, there aren't enough women at Twitter or in the tech world because there aren't enough women anywhere. Some facts: Women make up 6% of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies, and that has taken years to accomplish. Most startups have all-male boards. In 2012 women held 16.6% of Fortune 500 board seats. Women of color were 3.3% of the total. Fully one-tenth had no women serving on their boards at all. In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability. Twitter had more than a year to prepare for this IPO: Where are the women? The company's immediate response  focused on a ""paucity of candidates."" The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system. However, companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes, yes, even women -- when seeking senior-level and board positions. It enables them to cross-pollinate ideas, diversify their expertise and innovate. For example, Apple has hired Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts. During her tenure at Burberry, the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price. Companies redefine ""pipeline"" every day -- particularly when profits are involved. The technology sector dresses itself up as progressive when in reality it shows every indication of being, at its core, powerfully retrograde. Despite investing in diversity programs, the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse, and indeed the industry continues to ""dazzle"" with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases. Last month's Titshare debacle (click and weep), as well as Business Insider's long-overdue firing of CTO Pax Dickinson (who'd for years been churning out such sexist, racist, tweets as ""Jesus gets raped by a pack of n****s. It's his own fault for dressing like a whore though"") are two recent examples. Second, sexism is seamlessly coupled with the distribution of capital. Bryan Goldberg's September launch of Bustle, a ""women's centric"" website (""world news and politics alongside beauty tips"") was a blunt force case in point. After announcing the site with a tone-deaf post, Goldberg was widely mocked for his personal failure to grasp, among other things, how ridiculous his claim to be starting the ""first site of its kind"" for women was. The real issue isn't Goldberg's cluelessness, but the institutional biases that enabled him to raise $6.5 million when far more able, knowledgeable and experienced women can't. Companies with at least one woman founder make up only 13% of those funded. Venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors. These are particular ironies since women-run startups use 40% less capital to launch. These facts don't reflect women lacking in confidence ideas. They illustrate discrimination, whether it is conscious or not. Third, while we think of Twitter as a tech company, it is a media company and part of a larger environment that does little to correct its failure at diversity. Year after year, studies such as one last week from the Directors Guild of America, as well as reports from Who Makes the News and the Women's Media Center Status on Women in Media document exactly how distorted mainstream media ownership, management and production remain. Only online is the situation improving. But even there the difference is largely gains in women-oriented ""pink-collar"" content. How can we separate these facts from ownership? We can't. As reported by the Federal Communications Commission, our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men. Lastly, what does this have to do with speech? Everything. Male experiences, interests, expectations and voices, mainly white, inform the way we think, decide how our resources are dispersed and define our norms. The ghettoized status of women and minorities in media and technology, coupled with the lack of venture capital investments, means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited, misrepresented and regularly repackaged to make what we say palatable to a sexist status quo. And this status quo is entirely uninterested in the idea of women as capable, autonomous leaders who might change norms in unsettling, risky ways. Stating these facts baldly is not an indictment of white men as individuals. It is a description of systemic problems that we refuse to confront with systemic solutions. The presence of a carefully selected handful of women in tech, regardless of how determined, able and prominently visible they are, has for decades done little to alter the makeup of management and ownership.  Gender diversity at Twitter, as elsewhere, isn't a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they believe will be profitable and successful: Twitter is looking for experience and expertise within a comfort zone. This to me is not a gender issue, it's an innovation issue, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has explained. Gender issues aren't innovation issues only if your gender is dominant and the norm. This rationale, and others like it, are exactly the kind of ""1,000 paper cuts"" marginalization that result in fewer women pursuing  tech careers to begin with. Twitter is one part of a male dominated social structure, economy and culture, all of which rely on cradle-to-grave sexism to be profitable. That's tweetable by the way.","Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company's lack of management diversity -- that is, women.
Some facts: Women make up 6% of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies, and that has taken years to accomplish.
In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability.
Venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors."

A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police said. He died early Friday, police said. He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, images Police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives, ""or any other clues that could lead to the involvement of other people,"" police said. Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 were wounded in the incident, which happened during the country's annual Queen's Day celebration, police said. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday.  See who the Dutch royal family are » As the bus moved along, a black hatchback zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change. Queens Day will never be the same, the Trouw newspaper said. ""The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a Queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"" The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper agreed. What is going to happen on the 30th of April next year? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"" Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances. The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.

0a1ad82d161d90d758240407cb8c8fcebff4a212.story,"Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited. Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949. Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of ""simple-living and hard struggle,"" as Chairman Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt. China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags. The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center. It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. ""The Chinese people have stood up!"" he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent. For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally. He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear. Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing. He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, over 550,000 ""rightist"" intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million Chinese. In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he rallied hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who lionized him like a demi-god. ""To rebel is justified!"" they proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise. Perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people's incomparable resilience and their ability to ""chi ku"" (eat bitterness, or bear hardship). Mao's reign is also credited for positive changes. He banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line and started a space program with China's first satellite launch. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations. Still, for three decades under Mao, China tried to break out of its backwardness and isolation but only met modest success. Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.  Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown » Soon enough, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the new paramount leader. Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world. His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector. Just south of Tiananmen, one landmark stands as a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does brisk business, with a large portrait of founder Colonel Sanders hanging on the three-story building. Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy. Old Guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a great deal of misgiving. The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform. After six weeks of heady demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed.  See landmark moments in China's 60 years » China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, the speed and breadth of which is unparalleled in the history of mankind. China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world. The People's Liberation Army, no longer a ""junkyard army,"" has emerged as a formidable military power capable of launching a human being into space and shooting down satellites.  Take a look inside China's space program » The People's Republic of China marks its 60th anniversary on Thursday with 300,000 participants and 60 floats to highlight the country's achievements in various sectors of the society and economy.  See anniversary preparations in photos » A military parade will feature goose-stepping troops marching down the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Modern military hardware -- tanks, armed personnel carriers, missiles, helicopters and fighter jets, all made in China -- will be on display. Fireworks will cap the festivities.  See how China has changed over 60 years » But pomp and pageantry aside, China's phenomenal economic growth over the decades has triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, endemic corruption, rising criminality, environmental degradation and social malaise. Millions of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, and social tension sometimes boil over into violent clashes. Chinese president Hu Jintao is pushing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society. ""To build a well-off society for 1.3 billion people and a democratic, civilized, harmonious and modernized country,"" he recently told a communist party meeting, ""China must firmly push reform and opening up and stick to its own path.""  Meet some of China's young communists » Like the cutting-edge CCTV tower intended to formally open this year but didn't after a celebratory fireworks display went awry and caused a fire, China's great achievements stand side by side with daunting challenges.","Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
